# Smart-Blind-Stick

Visually impaired have a deficiency in their vision which has limitations in terms of mobility. On the other side, the blind must also run their daily activities. The developed project serves the best solution to overcome the difficulties of blind people, so that they can easily mobilize themselves, be a more successful part of society. Our main objective is to make it a compact and portable stick for users. The salient features of the developed prototype are ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and GPS tracking system to trigger a predefined message in hard situations. The ultrasonic sensor on detecting the obstacle signals the Arduino uno through the collected data and sends a warning in the form of sound through buzzer. GPS tracking system which adds exponential value in terms of safety of the user. This GPS works on a buzzer mechanism that triggers a predefined message. The experimental results shows that the developed prototype is much more efficient and usable in varying situations for a blind person as compared to the ordinary white sticks. A simple, cheap, configurable, easy to handle electronic guidance system is proposed to provide constructive assistant and support for blind and visually impaired persons.
